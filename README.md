I have created a simple endless runner in unity...The assets used were of unity whereas the coding was done by me...You simply have to press spacebar to jump and avoid the obstacles...Pl ignore any bugs as i have just started making games and am new to it....Click on the rar folder and click on the raw button (if it is present) to download as for some reason it doesent allow you to show that much files..This game is for mac/windows/linux
